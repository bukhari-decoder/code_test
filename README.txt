----------------------------------------Booking Controller Starts--------------------------------------


For Booking Controller things I noticed and that needs to be fixed is explained below
-----------------------------------------------

1. Some methods have multiple responsibilities.For instance, the distanceFeed function on line 187 handles data validation, data retrieval, and data updating.
2. Multiple methods have repetitive code structures, which can be moved to reusable functions.
3. I used request Input validation should be done using Laravel's Request validation.
4. Use JsonResponse for consistent API responses.
5. All methods now return a JsonResponse for consistent API responses.
6. Added isAdmin method to encapsulate the logic for checking if a user is an admin.
7. Simplified the assignments in distanceFeed function.
8. Used direct assignments and ternary operators for boolean values instead of string comparisons.
9. I noticed it have necessary else statements so I cleaned up the code by removing unnecessary else statements.
10. Ensured that the repository is properly injected and used consistently across methods.
11. Used appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages. with try catch.

I changed in the index function reason:
Improved readability and reusability by abstracting the admin check into a helper method and ensuring consistent JSON responses.

changed in the store function reason:
Consistent JSON response formatting.

changed in the distanceFeed function reason:
Simplified and cleaned up logic, ensuring consistent JSON responses and proper validation.

These changes improve the overall maintainability, readability, and reliability of the code of Booking Controller.

----------------------------------------Booking Repository Starts--------------------------------------


For BookingRepository I do the following changes function bases:
-----------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------

For getUsersJobs Function I do the following changes:
1. Moved logger initialization to a separate method initializeLogger
2. Used early returns to simplify the flow in getUsersJobs.
3. Created getJobsByUserType and categorizeJobs functions for better readability and separation of concerns.
-------------------

For getUsersJobsHistory Function I do the following changes:
1. We use a simpler method provided by the Laravel Request class, which allows us to get the page parameter and specify a default value (1) if the parameter is not present.
2. We immediately return a default response if the user is not found. because This reduces the nesting of conditions, making the code easier to read and understand. It quickly handles the case where the user does not exist, avoiding unnecessary execution of further code.
3. We create separate functions (getCustomerJobHistory and getTranslatorJobHistory) to handle the job histories for customers and translators, respectively because Extracting this logic into separate methods adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), which states that a function should have only one reason to change. This makes each method more focused and the main method (getUsersJobsHistory) cleaner and more readable.
4. We create a buildResponse method to centralize the response creation logic, This reduces redundancy and ensures that all response-related logic is handled in one place, making it easier to manage and less prone to errors.
5. We add type hints for method parameters and specify return types for all methods.
-------------------------

2. For Translator Type Determination and Translator Level Determination Used a switch statement to clearly map job types to translator types, making it easy to add or modify job types in the future.
3. Simplified the query to get blacklisted translator IDs using pluck directly, eliminating the need for intermediate collection manipulations.
